<h2>Why I love 11ty (and JAMstack) for building static sites...</h2>

  Web Development in 2020 is confusing...
</h2>

<p>I'll be honest, it's been <strong><em>really</em></strong> hard to keep up with web development technologies over the past 10 years.</p>

<p>For someone like me (someone who understands <em>basic</em> HTML, CSS and JavaScript) the myriad of frameworks can be extremely daunting. I feel like the barrier to entry for a lot of them is so high and they all seem to be overkill for what I need.</p>

<p>David Wickes seems to agree:</p>

<p>But now it seems like there's a new trend emerging that seems oddly familiar - <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMstack</a>. Rather than these highly reactive and fully-loaded websites, why don't we just generate static files and serve those! (How very 90's!)</p>

  Turn JAMstack up to 11ty
</h2>

<p>Upon first glance at some of the <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">suggested tools</a> to generate JAMstack sites, a lot of them still had <strong>way</strong> too much bloat. When I came across <a href="//11ty.dev">11ty</a> (pronounced 'eleventy) though, it immediately appealed and was super easy to get to grips with.</p>

<p>Rather than being a framework used at runtime or some server-side 'on-the-fly' site generator, 11ty runs as a <strong>compiler</strong>. It takes inputs, glues them together (really quickly!) and outputs a static site. Simple. </p>

<p>There are several great tutorials on the official 11ty site for beginners, but Omar Sinan does a great job here on Dev.to:</p>

<p>For me, I'm a very visual person so I've tried to illustrate how 11ty works for my development needs in this diagram:</p>

<p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QYmN9x5B--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/sgo9z7ui1rzn3r7snv8p.png" class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--QYmN9x5B--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/sgo9z7ui1rzn3r7snv8p.png" alt="How 11ty works"></a><br>
<em>(FYI, I do all my diagrams in <a href="https://excalidraw.com">Excalidraw</a> - read about why <a href="https://medium.com/@ndsn/why-excalidraw-is-mightier-than-the-pen-and-the-sword-47ecea8e81">here</a>!)</em></p>
<h2>
  <a href="#lets-break-it-down" class="anchor">
  </a>
  Let's break it down
</h2>

<p><strong>Input Files</strong></p>

<p>One of the biggest selling points for 11ty for me. One of the biggest issues I had with trying to build sites in pure HTML was that if I wanted to re-use a nav-bar or footer I had to literally copy and paste the code. </p>

<p>11ty does away with this and lets us use a huge array of templating languages, most notably <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid">Liquid</a> and Markdown - and even lets us mix and match. Perfect! </p>

<p>But we can also augment our input templates with data (either local or remote) and generate static files based on our layouts and data at compile time. This makes it <a href="https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog">super easy to create blog sites</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>

<p>Have files that you don't want 11ty to modify, like CSS or images? Just pass them through in the config:<br>
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight javascript"><code><span class="nx">eleventyConfig</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">addPassthroughCopy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">**/*.jpg</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nx">eleventyConfig</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">addPassthroughCopy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">path/to/css</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>



<p>And they'll just appear in the finished build.</p>

<p><strong>Static Site</strong></p>

<p>The output of 11ty's magic - it's just pure HTML, CSS (and JavaScript/Images if you have them).</p>

<p>Which means that two things suddenly become a <strong>lot</strong> easier:</p>

<ol>
<li>Deployment - <em>Host your site literally anywhere that accepts static files. Or go for JAMstack-specific hosting providers like Netlify and Vercel.</em>
</li>
<li>Testing - <em>Can be as simple as loading up the HTML file in your browser, or you can integrate automated testing with tools like Cypress or Jest/Puppeteer.</em>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>
  <a href="#but-i-want-more" class="anchor">
  </a>
  But I want more!
</h2>

<p>Sure - other static site generators might do more. </p>

<p>And a fully-fledged framework might work better for project X or 'my-react-app25'. </p>

<p>But for someone who just wants to re-use their Navbar and Footer across all pages of their personal website or create a blog that they can host anywhere, I couldn't recommend 11ty highly enough.</p>

<p>I even rebuilt <a href="https://github.com/Driminary/thomas-anderson.net">my own website</a> using 11ty*!</p>

<p><em>(*Yes, I used TailwindCSS to style it. CSS is hard. ðŸ˜‰)</em></p>

<h2>
  <a href="#let-me-know-what-you-think" class="anchor">
  </a>
  Let me know what you think!
</h2>

<ul>
<li>Have you used 11ty and/or do you prefer a different static site generator? </li>
<li>Why?</li>
</ul>
