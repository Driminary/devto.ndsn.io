<h2>Web Development in 2020 is confusing...</h2>
<p>I'll be honest, it's been <em><strong>really</strong></em> hard to keep up with web development technologies over the past 10 years.</p>
<p>For someone like me (someone who understands <em>basic</em> HTML, CSS and JavaScript) the myriad of frameworks can be extremely daunting. I feel like the barrier to entry for a lot of them is so high and they all seem to be overkill for what I need.</p>
<p>David Wickes seems to agree:</p>

<p>But now it seems like there's a new trend emerging that seems oddly familiar - <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMstack</a>. Rather than these highly reactive and fully-loaded websites, why don't we just generate static files and serve those! (How very 90's!)</p>
<h2>Turn JAMstack up to 11ty</h2>
<p>Upon first glance at some of the <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">suggested tools</a> to generate JAMstack sites, a lot of them still had <strong>way</strong> too much bloat. When I came across <a href="11ty.dev">11ty</a> (pronounced 'eleventy) though, it immediately appealed and was super easy to get to grips with.</p>
<p>Rather than being a framework used at runtime or some server-side 'on-the-fly' site generator, 11ty runs as a <strong>compiler</strong>. It takes inputs, glues them together (really quickly!) and outputs a static site. Simple.</p>
<p>There are several great tutorials on the official 11ty site for beginners, but Omar Sinan does a great job here on Dev.to:</p>

<p>For me, I'm a very visual person so I've tried to illustrate how 11ty works for my development needs in this diagram:</p>
